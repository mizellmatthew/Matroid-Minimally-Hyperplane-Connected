# Matroid-Minimally-Hyperplane-Connected
A matroid M is hyperplane connected if every hyperplane of M is connected. A matroid M is minimally hyperplane connected if M is hyperplane connected and deleting any point of M will make M-e not hyperplane connected. This program will find all minimally hyperplane connected matroids of a given rank. It is written in SageMath and uses the matroid package.
